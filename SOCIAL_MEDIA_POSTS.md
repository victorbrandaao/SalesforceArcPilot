# Building a Modern Salesforce Org Manager: Lessons from Developing a Chrome Extension

## The Problem

Every Salesforce developer knows the struggle: you're working with 5+ orgs (dev, staging, prod, scratch orgs), constantly switching between them, losing track of which environment you're in, and drowning in browser bookmarks.

After wasting countless hours on this daily friction, I decided to build **Salesforce ArcPilot** - a Chrome extension that solves org management once and for all.

## What I Built

A modern, lightweight Chrome extension that:

- Integrates with Salesforce CLI to auto-detect authenticated orgs
- Allows manual org management with custom aliases
- Provides instant search and filtering
- Offers a clean, accessible UI with dark/light themes
- Supports internationalization (English/Portuguese)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?

While frameworks are great, for a Chrome extension this size, vanilla JS provided:

- Smaller bundle size
- Faster load times
- No dependency management overhead
- Direct access to Chrome APIs

### Architecture Choices

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server for CLI integration
- **Storage**: Chrome Extension Storage API
- **Manifest**: V3 for future-proofing

## Key Learnings

1. **Chrome Extension Gotchas**: Manifest V3 service workers behave differently than traditional background scripts
2. **CLI Integration**: Parsing Salesforce CLI output requires careful error handling
3. **UX for Developers**: Developers want speed and simplicity over fancy animations
4. **Internationalization**: Chrome's i18n API is powerful but requires careful planning

## The Result

What used to take 30+ seconds (finding the right bookmark, opening new tab, waiting for login) now takes 2 clicks and loads in under a second.

The extension is open source and already helping developers save hours per week.

# Building a Chrome Extension with Salesforce CLI Integration

As a Salesforce developer, I constantly found myself juggling multiple orgs - production, sandboxes, scratch orgs, and development environments. The daily routine of bookmarking, CLI commands, and manual environment switching was eating away at my productivity.

That's when I decided to build **Salesforce ArcPilot** - a Chrome extension that automates org management and provides seamless CLI integration.

## The Problem ü§î

Managing multiple Salesforce environments typically involves:

- Maintaining dozens of bookmarks
- Running repetitive CLI commands (`sf org list`, `sf org open`)
- Manually copying and pasting org URLs
- Losing track of sandbox expiration dates
- Cluttered browser bookmark bars

This workflow was costing me 10+ minutes daily - that's over 40 hours per year! üò±

## The Solution üí°

I envisioned a Chrome extension that would:

1. **Auto-detect** CLI authenticated orgs
2. **Enable one-click** org access via CLI
3. **Provide smart search** and favorites
4. **Offer a modern** responsive UI
5. **Support multiple languages**

## Architecture Overview üèóÔ∏è

The extension uses a three-tier architecture:
```

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

````

### Why This Architecture?

Chrome extensions can't directly execute system commands due to security restrictions. The solution is a local Node.js server that acts as a bridge between the extension and the Salesforce CLI.

## Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Chrome Extension (Frontend)

**Manifest V3 Configuration:**
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Salesforce ArcPilot",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "tabs",
    "activeTab"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://localhost:3000/*"
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup/popup.html"
  }
}
````

**Key Features:**

- **Chrome Storage API** for persistent data
- **Chrome Tabs API** for opening orgs
- **Chrome i18n API** for internationalization
- **Modern CSS** with glassmorphism design

### 2. Local Server (Backend)

**Express.js Server:**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { exec } = require("child_process");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// CORS configuration for Chrome extension
const corsOptions = {
  origin: ["chrome-extension://your-extension-id"],
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
app.use(express.json());

// Get CLI authenticated orgs
app.get("/api/orgs", (req, res) => {
  exec("sf org list --json", { timeout: 30000 }, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }

    try {
      const orgs = JSON.parse(stdout);
      res.json(orgs);
    } catch (parseError) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to parse CLI output" });
    }
  });
});

// Open org via CLI
app.post("/api/org/open", (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.body;

  exec(`sf org open --target-org ${username}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }
    res.json({ success: true });
  });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`üöÄ Salesforce ArcPilot Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### 3. Salesforce CLI Integration

The extension leverages several CLI commands:

- `sf org list --json` - Get authenticated orgs
- `sf org open --target-org USERNAME` - Open specific org
- `sf org display --target-org USERNAME` - Get org details

## Key Technical Challenges & Solutions üß©

### Challenge 1: CORS Handling

**Problem:** Chrome extensions have strict CORS policies.
**Solution:** Configure server with specific extension origin allowlist.

### Challenge 2: CLI Output Parsing

**Problem:** CLI output format can vary.
**Solution:** Robust JSON parsing with fallback error handling.

### Challenge 3: Timeout Management

**Problem:** CLI commands can hang indefinitely.
**Solution:** Configurable timeouts (30s default) with graceful error handling.

### Challenge 4: Popup Size Constraints

**Problem:** Chrome extension popups have limited space.
**Solution:** Responsive design with collapsible sections and smart layout.

## Modern UI/UX Design üé®

The extension features a glassmorphism design with:

```css
.popup-container {
  width: 520px;
  max-height: 850px;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border-radius: 16px;
}

.org-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 12px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.org-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

**Key UI Features:**

- **Dark mode support** with system preference detection
- **Smooth animations** and hover effects
- **Responsive layout** for different screen sizes
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback
- **Skeleton loading** states

## Performance Optimizations ‚ö°

### 1. Memory Usage

- **Target:** <5MB total memory consumption
- **Achievement:** Lightweight vanilla JS implementation

### 2. Startup Time

- **Target:** <200ms initial load
- **Achievement:** Minimal dependencies and optimized CSS

### 3. CLI Operations

- **Caching:** Store CLI results for 30 seconds
- **Timeouts:** Prevent hanging operations
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful fallbacks for failed commands

## Internationalization üåç

The extension supports multiple languages using Chrome's i18n API:

```javascript
// messages.json structure
{
  "appName": {
    "message": "Salesforce ArcPilot",
    "description": "Application name"
  },
  "cliOrgs": {
    "message": "CLI Authenticated Orgs",
    "description": "Section title for CLI orgs"
  }
}

// Usage in JavaScript
const message = chrome.i18n.getMessage('appName');

// Usage in HTML
<span data-i18n="cliOrgs"></span>
```

Currently supports:

- **English** (default)
- **Portuguese** (pt_BR)

## Security Considerations üîí

### 1. CORS Restrictions

- Server only accepts requests from known extension IDs
- No external API calls or data transmission

### 2. Input Validation

- All user inputs are sanitized
- CLI command injection prevention

### 3. Local Storage Only

- No cloud data transmission
